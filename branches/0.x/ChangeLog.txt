JGlideMon ChangeLog

Version 0.17
------------
- Fixed Parse Log File dialog box and added a progress bar
  if the log file is very large.
- Added fullscreen option to the Screenshot menu.

Version 0.16
------------
- Added a bunch of options to control alerts. See the Alerts
  configuration tab.
- Added ability to retrieve item's mediam AH price instead of
  vendor price based on its name or quality. See the Loot
  configuration tab.
- A spiffy help file is now distributed with JGlideMon.
- A spiffy installer is now available for Windows.

Version 0.15
------------
- Multiple Glider support is finally available. You no longer need
  to run separate copies of JGlideMon to monitor multiple Gliders.
  This functionality is accessible via the Servers menu.
- You can now change JGlideMon's icon that appears in the tray
  and the taskbar.
- The configuration settings have been converted to Java's
  built in Properties type. Your JGlideMon.ini will automatically
  be converted to JGlideMon.properties.
- The Stuck configuration tab has been renamed Restarter.
  Additionally, options have been added to restart Glider
  when an exception log entry is received shortly before
  a status entry indicating Glider stopped, when
  "Inventory does not appear to be going up" is received,
  (I have this problem when BottomlessBag autosells it lags,
  this affects profiles that have vendor waypoints),
  and when "Couldn't activate flight" is received when running
  profile groups. There is a built in delay before sending the
  /startglide command again for all options.
- Renamed Urgent Log tab to Urgent and added sub-tabs for
  Logs and a new Followers tab that tracks "New friend",
  "Removing friend", and "Being followed by" Glider log entries.
- Added a sub-menu to the Screenshots menu for restoring,
  shrinking, and hiding the WoW windows (assuming you're
  dual gliding/running background mode). Note that if a
  window is hidden, it must be restored first before you
  can shrink it again. This is a limitation of Glider.
- There is now a setting in the Restarter configuration tab
  to shrink/hide/do nothing to the WoW window after JGM
  has restarted Glider. This also affects when you send
  chat.
- Added support for custom sounds. If you want to replace a sound,
  create a directory called "sounds" and drop in an aptly named
  WAV file. The files you can replace are: "Whisper.wav",
  "GMWhisper.wav", "PlayerAttack.wav", "PlayerNear.wav",
  "GlideStop.wav".

Version 0.14
------------
- Sending chat is now at the bottom of the Chat tab and
  the Keys tab has been removed.
- Now when keys are sent, /stopglide is sent first, followed
  by the keys, followed by /startglide (if Glider was already
  running). Also, separate /queuekeys commands are sent for an
  initial enter (#13#), the slash, and the slash command with
  a slight delay in between each to help account for the 
  problems with /queuekeys not always sending the keys.
  This is also reflected in PHPGlideMon. 
  It may not be perfect but I'm pretty sure the real problem
  is with Glider.
- Added Reply and Guild options for sending chat.
- Added the use of the "/escapehi on" command. Special characters
  should now be seen in the logs. Note that you won't be able
  to send the special characters, but you can at least see them.
  This means you cannot whisper people with special characters
  in their name directly. This is a limitation of Glider's remote
  interface as far as I can tell. You can send a reply message 
  instead of a regular whisper if they were the last person to
  whisper you.
- Changed it so that logging.properties and logging.debug.properties
  are now embedded within JGlideMon.jar and not in the base folder.
  You may delete these files if you are upgrading. Not deleting them
  will not cause any harm, but they will just sit there.
- The Experience pane (time to level, xp progress bar, etc.) will now
  be hidden if you are at the level cap. I have programmed it such
  that it will reappear if your xp percentage is greater than 1%,
  which would imply that the cap has been raised due to a new expansion.
  The idea of this is to declutter the GUI as well as provide some extra
  screen real estate for the screenshots.
- Some functionality has been rearranged to be utilized by menus. Namely,
  the "Enable Sending Keystrokes" checkbox and the "Refresh Screenshot
  Immediately" button have been moved to a Screenshot menu. Again, this is
  to declutter the GUI/provide real estate for screenshots. Also, a Logs
  menu has been added with associated functions.
- Added a popup message when an urgent log entry is received. This requires
  Java 1.6+ as well as the system tray option to be enabled. JGlideMon
  should still function with Java 1.5, but you will not receive the
  messages.
- A Glider log entry containing "Died while gliding" is now considered
  an urgent log entry. It is considered a Status sound, in case you
  don't want to hear a sound when you die.
- Mobs that you kill will now appear in the Mobs tab even if you are at
  the level cap.
- Log entry types are now color coded. Additionally, chat logs are now
  colored, similarly to how they are in-game.

Version 0.12
------------
- Added Public Chat tab to the Chat tab that contains only
  chat from the public channels (i.e. General/Trade).
- Added ability to parse Glider chat and combat log files.
  Accessed via File->Parse Log File. After you select a file
  from the file chooser, it will automatically select Chat or
  Combat as the log type if the file name contains the word 
  Chat or Combat. If the log file is named something else,
  you will need to manually select the correct type. Note 
  that the timestamps are only accurate to the minute, since
  this is how they are stored when Glider makes the log files.
  Also, the estimated gold/hour on the loot tab wil not be
  accurate since that is calculated in realtime.
- Moved the Load Profiles section into its own tab.
- Made the Configuration dialog more consistent.
- Completely revamped the web server. Added an update
  interval option on the Web tab in the Confiuration dialog.
  Additionally, I have merged my PHP based monitor (now PHPGlideMon)
  with this project.

Version 0.11
------------
- Added an embedded webserver. It is disabled by default. See
  the Web tab in the configuration dialog to enable it. The
  default port is 3201; visit http://localhost:3201 to view it.
  You will need to forward this port if you are behind a router
  in order to view it from a remote location. Note that this is
  still in a very early stage and is not the highest priority
  feature. For now it's read-only and shows your status. It is
  based on my original PHP-based monitor, which others have
  improved upon.
- Clicking on an item on the Loot tab will open a browser window
  to the Allakhazam page for that item. You can change the site that
  is opened in the General tab of the configuration dialog. Wowhead,
  Thottbot, and Allakhazam are already in the combo box. If you want
  to add a different url, %s will be replaced with the item id.
- Added an auto-scale feature for the screenshot that should adjust
  the scale whenever you resize the window. This takes effect the next
  time the screenshot is updated. This is enabled by default and can be
  disabled via the screenshot options tab.
- Added a tab that graphs your health, mana, and target's health over
  time.
- Status information should now be cleared when you are disconnected
  from Glider.

Version 0.10
------------
- Added Mobs/Rep/Skills tab. Note: I have no way of testing if rep
  is detected properly when you get rep for killing a mob (I no longer
  have a high level character to kill mobs that would give rep). It
  works when you turn in a quest; if you get the same message in the
  chatlog when you kill a mob as when you turn in a quest it should
  work.
- The tab that was selected when you close the program will now
  be selected when you start it the next time
- Fixed error when you run the program for the first time and the
  config dialog doesn't close when you press the save button
- Added Stuck tab to configuration dialog. Now when "Stuck too many times"
  is received it will send the /startglide command. Note that this
  option is disabled by default. If Glider gets stuck 'Stuck Limit' 
  number of times within 'Limit Timeout' seconds it will give up.
  After 'Limit Timeout' seconds without receiving the stuck message, 
  the counter will be reset to 0. Note: this feature has not been
  thouroughly tested! (Ideally you're profiles won't let you get stuck)
- Added better detection for druid "mana". It should now display
  the percentage of rage, energy, or mana, whichever is appropriate.
  Note: this has only had limited testing.
- Added cardinal directions and degrees tooltip for when you mouse over
  the direction indicator as well as tooltips for health/mana/xp bars
- Added color coding of target level
- Removed Attach button since Glider automatically attaches

Version 0.9.1
-------------
- Added scrollbars to screenshot when image is too large to fit
- JGlideMon now released under the GNU GPL, see License.txt for
  more information

Version 0.9
-------------
- Added some extra debugging features, namely Help->Generate Debug Info,
  and File->Configuration->General->Log Debugging Info. Logs are also
  saved to Log.txt
- Added config options for the screenshot updater's buffer
  size and the timeout for updating a screenshot. The config window
  will tell you the size of your last screenshot and calculate the
  maximum size that it could be. This size represents an uncompressed
  image size. Keep in mind that the image is in fact compressed as
  a jpeg. Setting the buffer to the calculated size should ensure
  you won't have a problem but it is a significant over-estimate.
- Added checkbox to disable sending of keystrokes when screenshot
  tab is the current tab (note it is disabled when the program is first
  launched). Also, the screenshot tab no longer requires keyboard
  focus to send keys.

Version 0.8
-----------
- Added support for a tray icon and minimizing to the tray
  if Java 1.6+ is installed (JGlideMon will still function
  with Java 1.5+, there just won't be a tray icon)
- Removed the need for a textfield to have focus to send keys
  in the screenshot tab. Now keys are sent as long as the
  screenshot tab is the current tab. Note that you are not able
  to send the 4 arrow keys as this would cause you to change
  the selected tab. Use WASD instead. Note that the Screenshot
  tab must still have focus, that is on most systems a dotted border
  appears around the word Screenshot on the actual tab.
- Added some code to try to help cope with when the screenshot
  fails to update. This is still a work in progress.
- Removed dependency on lib/componentset.jar, you may delete this
  file manually if you wish, though it won't harm anything if it
  remains. This library was 500kb and I was only using 2 features
  that I was able to replicate myself.

Version 0.7
-----------
- Fixed connection issues with non-Windows operating systems

Version 0.6
-----------
- Added support for loading profiles. Run Profiler.jar on the
  computer where Glider is running to create a "profiles.dat"
  file and copy that file to the same directory as JGlideMon.jar
  on the remote computer you will run JGlideMon on. JGlideMon will
  detect profiles.dat and read it into a list of profiles that
  can be loaded. (The whole point of this is so you don't have
  to remember the exact paths of all your profiles or type them
  in manually, but that option is available if you wish)
- Added the removal of timestamps from in-game chat timestamp mods
  (CTMod style at least [hh:mm:ss] or [h:mm] for example)
- Internal changes to improve the storage of configuration data have
  required that you delete your current JGlideMon.ini file. While
  it won't hurt anything to not delete it, you will have to re-enter
  your network settings anyway and it will clutter your ini file.
  If you really don't want to delete it, change the "[network]" line
  to "[net]" and change all keys to be lowercase, i.e. "updateInterval=..."
  would become "updateinterval=...".
- Values in the configuration dialog should now be correctly refreshed
  when you cancel changes and reopen the dialog
- Implemented auto-reconnection to Glider. Settings for delay between
  attemps and number of attemps can be found in the Network config
  section.

Version 0.5
-----------
- Added item/icon caching. *.cache files will be created that
  will reduce the number of connections made to wow.allakhazam.com.
  These files can be deleted without causing any problems
- Fixed error in parsing items from the chatlog that was causing
  some items to not be recognized
- Each log tab now has an upper limit on the number of entries that
  will be displayed. By defualt this is 500 and can be changed in
  the [log] section of JGlideMon.ini. I have not had time to create
  a section in the configuration dialog for this.
- Fixed error that was not terminating updater threads upon disconnect
  from Glider, which was causing sporadic behavior when you reconnected
- Added sounds on being followed, being attacked, stuck too many times
- Log entries starting with a ! will be added to the urgent log tab
  and that tab will be selected

Version 0.4
-----------
- Fixed detection of mana/rage/energy for all classes
  (druids not yet tested)
- Moved configuration from a tab to a dialog (accessible via
  File -> Configuration)
- Reduced item icon size to 32x32 on the loot tab
- Added sell price per stack (and stack quantity) of an item
  on the item tooltip
- Added Gold/Hour estimate to loot tab
- Various internal improvements to use less memory (hopefully)
- Improved use of the window title

Version 0.3
-----------
- Added text-to-speech support
- Improved use of the status bar
- Connect/Disconnect buttons now work
- Improved detection of being disconencted from Glider/
  not being able to connect

Version 0.2
-----------
- Added sounds when whispered/someone said something nearby
- Added sending keys to Glider/replying to people who whisper you
- Added sending mouse clicks when you click on the screenshot
- Added forcing keys from the screenshot tab (i.e. press C to
  make your character frame show)

Version 0.1
-----------
- Initial Release
