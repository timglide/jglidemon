JGlideMon ChangeLog

Version 0.5
-----------
- Added item/icon caching. *.cache files will be created that
  will reduce the number of connections made to wow.allakhazam.com.
  These files can be deleted without causing any problems
- Fixed error in parsing items from the chatlog that was causing
  some items to not be recognized
- Each log tab now has an upper limit on the number of entries that
  will be displayed. By defualt this is 500 and can be changed in
  the [log] section of JGlideMon.ini. I have not had time to create
  a section in the configuration dialog for this.
- Fixed error that was not terminating updater threads upon disconnect
  from Glider, which was causing sporadic behavior when you reconnected
- Added sounds on being followed, being attacked, stuck too many times
- Log entries starting with a ! will be added to the urgent log tab
  and that tab will be selected
