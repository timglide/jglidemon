JGlideMon ChangeLog

Version 0.6
-----------
- Added support for loading profiles. Run Profiler.jar on the
  computer where Glider is running to create a "profiles.dat"
  file and copy that file to the same directory as JGlideMon.jar
  on the remote computer you will run JGlideMon on. JGlideMon will
  detect profiles.dat and read it into a list of profiles that
  can be loaded. (The whole point of this is so you don't have
  to remember the exact paths of all your profiles or type them
  in manually, but that option is available if you wish)
- Added the removal of timestamps from in-game chat timestamp mods
  (CTMod style at least [hh:mm:ss] or [h:mm] for example)
- Internal changes to improve the storage of configuration data have
  required that you delete your current JGlideMon.ini file. While
  it won't hurt anything to not delete it, you will have to re-enter
  your network settings anyway and it will clutter your ini file.
  If you really don't want to delete it, change the "[network]" line
  to "[net]" and change all keys to be lowercase, i.e. "updateInterval=..."
  would become "updateinterval=...".
- Values in the configuration dialog should now be correctly refreshed
  when you cancel changes and reopen the dialog

Version 0.5
-----------
- Added item/icon caching. *.cache files will be created that
  will reduce the number of connections made to wow.allakhazam.com.
  These files can be deleted without causing any problems
- Fixed error in parsing items from the chatlog that was causing
  some items to not be recognized
- Each log tab now has an upper limit on the number of entries that
  will be displayed. By defualt this is 500 and can be changed in
  the [log] section of JGlideMon.ini. I have not had time to create
  a section in the configuration dialog for this.
- Fixed error that was not terminating updater threads upon disconnect
  from Glider, which was causing sporadic behavior when you reconnected
- Added sounds on being followed, being attacked, stuck too many times
- Log entries starting with a ! will be added to the urgent log tab
  and that tab will be selected

Version 0.4
-----------
- Fixed detection of mana/rage/energy for all classes
  (druids not yet tested)
- Moved configuration from a tab to a dialog (accessible via
  File -> Configuration)
- Reduced item icon size to 32x32 on the loot tab
- Added sell price per stack (and stack quantity) of an item
  on the item tooltip
- Added Gold/Hour estimate to loot tab
- Various internal improvements to use less memory (hopefully)
- Improved use of the window title

Version 0.3
-----------
- Added text-to-speech support
- Improved use of the status bar
- Connect/Disconnect buttons now work
- Improved detection of being disconencted from Glider/
  not being able to connect

Version 0.2
-----------
- Added sounds when whispered/someone said something nearby
- Added sending keys to Glider/replying to people who whisper you
- Added sending mouse clicks when you click on the screenshot
- Added forcing keys from the screenshot tab (i.e. press C to
  make your character frame show)

Version 0.1
-----------
- Initial Release
