== JGlideMon ==

JGlideMon is distributed as a zip file, which can be used to install JGlideMon on any platform that Java is supported on as well as an executable installer for Windows.

The version number is X.X.YYY where X.X is the main version and YYY is the revision number. If there is a small change, the revision may increase but not the main version.

Available files include:
  * *JGlideMon_vX.X.YYY_core.zip* - This is the standalone core zip archive.
  * *JGlideMon_vX.X.YYY_core_setup.exe* - This is the setup program for the core program.
  * *JGlideMon_vX.X.YYY_full_setup.exe* - This is the setup program that includes option libraries, namely the text-to-speech feature. If you already have the TTS libraries installed, you can download the core setup. They will not be deleted.

== PHPGlideMon ==

The version numbers for PHPGlideMon are the same as JGlideMon, though PHPGlideMon may not be updated when JGlideMon is if there are no changes to JGlideMon's built-in webserver.
